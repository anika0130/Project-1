            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Greetings, I'm Anika Jabor, a budding enthusiast in the vast realm
              of web development. At the tender age of 15, I find myself
              embarking on a thrilling journey through the corridors of
              knowledge in grade 9. With fervor and determination, I've recently
              delved into the captivating world of HTML and CSS, dedicating
              myself to mastering these foundational languages of the web. As I
              craft my inaugural website, each line of code serves as a
              testament to my newfound passion and unwavering commitment to
              expand my skills. Though I've only begun this exhilarating
              adventure a mere week ago, the boundless possibilities that lie
              ahead ignite a sense of excitement within me, propelling me
              forward on this exhilarating path of discovery.
            </p>
